## About Me:
I am 53 years old. By education, I am a teacher of mathematics and computer science. 

Programming was interesting even at the institute, I encountered web development at the beginning of its formation. But it so happened that it was not possible to develop in these directions.

At work, I often had to study new software, install it, worked a little with servers, hosting, etc.

Now I have decided to change the direction of my activity, I am studying layout and frontend development.

### Assignment: 
**The function countChars() counts how many times a letter enters a sentence and takes into account the case of letters. Implement a variant of the same function, so that letter case does not matter:**


```
// BEGIN (write your solution here)
const countChars = (str, char) => {
  let i = 0;
  let count = 0;
  while (i < str.length) {
    if ((str[i] === char.toLowerCase()) || (str[i] === char.toUpperCase())) {
      count = count + 1;
    }
    i = i + 1;
  }
  return count;
}
// END

export default countChars;
```
